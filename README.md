# Msc-Project
Development of a set of graph-plotting templates of common types of graphs used in NLP papers using Vega-Lite

# VSCode document
using VSCode to complete the scatter plot, code for Chapter 4.3.

index.html is the Vega-Lite specification, which need to be embeded in VSCode in advance.

index.js is the related framework code in my project Implementation phrase.

# Scatter Plot document
Chapter 4.3 includes codes, dataset and visualization effect of scatter plot used in my Implementation stage, details information can be seen as my dissertation.

Chapter 5.1.1 & 5.1.2 & 5.1.3 includes codes, dataset and visualization effect of scatter plot in my Evaluation stage, details information can be seen as my dissertation. 

"Framework" is summarized after testing multiple images. Users only need to fill in the title, x-axis and y-axis information. The code can be directly copied and pasted into the Vega-Lite Online Editor to run.

“Sample data format” is a unified format of the corresponding code “Framework”, and the user only needs to fill in the corresponding data. Because Vega-Lite has very strict requirements on the data format.

# Stacked Bar Plot document
Chapter 4.4 includes codes, dataset and visualization effect of scatter plot used in my Implementation stage, details information can be seen as my dissertation.

Chapter 5.2.1 & 5.2.2 & 5.2.3 includes codes, dataset and visualization effect of scatter plot in my Evaluation stage, details information can be seen as my dissertation. 

"Framework" is summarized after testing multiple images. Users only need to fill in the title, x-axis and y-axis information. The code can be directly copied and pasted into the Vega-Lite Online Editor to run.
